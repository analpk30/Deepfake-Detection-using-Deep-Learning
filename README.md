# Deepfake-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Deepfakes, which are synthetic media where a person's likeness is replaced with someone else's, pose significant threats in various domains, including security, misinformation, and privacy. This project aims to develop a robust deepfake detection system leveraging deep learning techniques combined with OpenCV and intraframe noise analysis.
